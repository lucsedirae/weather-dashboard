# Touch of Grey - Weather Dashboard
Touch of Grey is a weather dashboard application that features a Grateful Dead theme<br>
Upon loading the app, the user is greeted with awelcome message and a search field.<br>
When the user enters a city name (currently only city names are supported, future versions<br>
will allow for search by state for improved specificity). When the user clicks the<br>
submit button, details of that city's current weather are displayed in the main details<br>
section of the page. Below the details section, a 5-day forecast is populated to give<br>
forecast information.<br> 
<br>
Cities that the user searches for are saved in their local storage and retrieved on loading<br>
the site. This allows users to click on a previously searched city and instantly retrieve<br>
current weather details.
